## So what are pseudo-selectors in CSS?

Pseudo classes are, quite simply, additional keywords that are tacked on to the end of certain selectors. They provide additional functionality, like ':hover' to create separate styling on hover events, and many many more. Pseudo selectors use the : syntax. Additional pseudo selectors include:

:active
:any ðŸ”¬
:any-link ðŸ”¬
:checked
:default
:dir() ðŸ”¬
:disabled
:empty
:enabled
:first
:first-child
:first-of-type
:fullscreen ðŸ”¬
:focus
:focus-within
:hover
:indeterminate
:in-range
:invalid
:lang
:last-child
:last-of-type
:left
:link
:not()
:nth-child
:nth-last-child
:nth-last-of-type
:nth-of-type
:only-child
:only-of-type
:optional
:out-of-range
:placeholder-shown ðŸ”¬
:read-only
:read-write
:required

## Then what are pseudo-elements?

Pseudo elements are different from pseudo selectors in that they are used to style particular parts of an element and utilize the :: syntax. Some more popular and well-adopted pseudo-elements are:

::after (:after)
::backdrop
::before (:before)
::first-letter (:first-letter)
::first-line (:first-line)
::selection
::cue (:cue)
