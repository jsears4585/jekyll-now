## Mongo DB

### History

MongoDB was founded in 2007 by previous members of the DoubleClick team, an internet advertising company that has since been bought-out by Google. MongoDB was open sourced in 2009, and the company now sells support and additional services, such as Atlas, Stitch and MongoDB Cloud Manager.

### Benefits of NoSQL vs. Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)

It should first be made clear that NoSQL isn't meant to replace or phase out traditional RDBM systems, but to instead add to the functionality companies like Oracle have been helping to develop over the past 40 years. That being said, the way in which NoSQL databases like MongoDB are set up offer some very helpful ways of dealing with data.
