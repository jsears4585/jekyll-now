## Simple Rails Tutorial

### Getting started

Go ahead and generate a rails application.

Done? Okay cool

### Now for the actual part...

We're not going to need much for this app, just a controller and a view. And some CSS. In truth, rails is way overkill for this type of application, but since we've already generated our framework, we can focus solely on calling the API, cleaning the results, and passing them to our views.

### APIs and you, a love story
